        description: AWSAccount is the Schema for the AWSAccounts API. Creates or
          imports an AWS Account and adds it to a Kion project or the Kion account
          cache. If account_number is provided, an existing account will be imported
          into Kion, otherwise a new AWS account will be created.  If project_id is
          provided the account will be added to the corresponding project, otherwise
          the account will be added to the account cache. Once added, an account can
          be moved between projects or in and out of the account cache by changing
          the project_id.  When moving accounts between projects, use move_project_settings
          to control how financials will be treated between the old and new project
